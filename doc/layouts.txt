Form Layouts
--------------------------------------------------

What are layouts?
-----------------

Layouts are a way of organizing elements on a form, for instance, suppose we have a form
with the title "Person form" and a series of elements in said form. For the purpose of this example
let's say this form has a "name" input field and an "age" input field plus a "submit" button.


If we would render said form, i.e show it to the end user, the most logical orden in which the elements
of said form would be shown would be the following:

	
	Title
	--------------------------

	Name [                   ]
	Age  [                   ]

	[ Submit ]

However, even if we assume this is the most logical order, an end user might want to change the way how these elements
are laid on the view port.

For instance, we could say that the end user wants the "age" field to be BEFORE than the "name" field, we could also 
say, to make a completely idiotic example, that the title would be between the name and the submit button.

According to the previously (stupid) described example, our form would look like this:


	Age  [                   ]
	Name [                   ]

	Title
	--------------------------

	[ Submit ]

Form Element Layouts
---------------------------------------------------

Assume we would like to specify that the label of a field is at the right of said form element, like this:

	Title
	--------------------------

	[                   ] Name
	[                   ] Age

	[ Submit ]

Example conclussions:
--------------------------------------------------

We can conclude that: 

A) A form has a Layout class, which is simply a way of organizing it's elements, their disposition on the view port.
B) A form element has a Layout class, which enables us to dispose the order of an element's attributes when showing said element.


\apf\ui\Layout (Main Layout class)
--------------------------------------------------

The main layout class is \apf\ui\Layout, is an abstract class which implements the \apf\iface\ui\Layout interface.

This class is common to Form Layouts and Form Element Layouts.

All derived Layout classes, regardless of it's user interface (web, cli, gtk) and regardless of the type of Form Element 
(form, form element [input,select, etc]) extend to this class. 

For instance, the \apf\ui\cli\element\Layout class, extends to \apf\ui\Layout class.

Layout parser
--------------------------------------------------


What is a Layout parser?
--------------------------------------------------

A Layout class has a Layout Parser. 

A Layout parser is a class which is able to receive a simple string containing the layout format for a form or a form element.

A Layout Parser is needed to be able to initialize a Layout from a configuration string.


Now, suppose we have the following form:

	Title
	--------------------------

	Name [                   ]
	Age  [                   ]

	[ Submit ]

The string to initialize the layout of the previous form would pretty much look something like this:

"%title% \n %name% \n %age% %submit%"

Everything seems to be pretty much simple, right? But! ...

Of course! Maybe you'd like to customize said form in the following way!

Set the title in blue
Set the name and age in black 
Set the submit button in a cool green color.

So, things DO get a little bit more complex ...

First, there are some questions we need to figure out:
------------------------------------------------------

What about the different user interfaces we have? Cli, Web ....

A) What about coloring output in a console?

B) What about adding a particular CSS class ?

C) What about coloring a certain input field red on a gtk user interface?

For this very reason: 
*********************

									A CLI Layout Parser exists
									A WEB Layout Parser exists
									A GTK Layout Parser (will, I think, exist)	


The apf\ui\layout\Parser class:
-----------------------------------------------------

This is the base class all layout parsers extend to, this class implements the \apf\iface\ui\layout\Parser interface.

The base class is able to *parse* the order in which elements are laid on a form or in a form element, however
it let's the corresponding implementation (Cli, Web, Gtk, etc) to parse
